I am a Machine Learning Engineer at [May Mobility](https://maymobility.com/). Previously, I earned my Master's degree in Robotics from the [GRASP Lab](https://www.grasp.upenn.edu/) at the [University of Pennsylvania](https://www.upenn.edu/), where I worked with [Prof. Lingjie Liu](https://lingjie0206.github.io/). I also had the pleasure of collaborating with [Prof. Chen Feng](https://engineering.nyu.edu/faculty/chen-feng)(NYU) and [Dr. Yiming Li](https://yimingli-page.github.io/)(NVIDIA). I hold dual Bachelor's degrees from the [University of Cincinnati](https://www.uc.edu/) and [Chongqing University](https://english.cqu.edu.cn/).

My research interests lie broadly in computer vision, machine learning, and robotics, with a particular focus on **3D Vision** and **World Model**. My goal is to advance robotic understanding and reasoning in the 3D physical world by developing physically aligned simulators and world models.


<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
